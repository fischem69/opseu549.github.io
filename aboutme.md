**Resources for members**

- ["The Collective Agreement"](https://opseu.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2015-2017_opseu_central_unified_agreement_-_final.pdf) is our work contract. It spells out the working conditions, benefits and salaries. It was extended in 2018 and [some additional aspects were added](https://opseu.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-2021_ops_unified_extension_agreement.pdf). Our salaries are listed in a [separate document](https://opseu.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/copy_of_opseu_salary_schedule_2017-2021_unified_send.pdf).

- The [owner's manual](https://opseu.org/information/owners-manual/12067/) gives a detailed overview of how OPSEU is organized.

- The [OPSEU constitution](https://opseu.org/information/tools-and-resources/ontario-public-service-employees-union-constitution-2019/92827/) describes in detail how OPSEU is organized.

- ["OPSEU Powertool"](https://opseu.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-04_en_powertool.pdf) - a comprehensive resource meant for stewards, but useful for anyone interested in how to get things done at the local. 

- OPSEU organizes a [range of events](https://opseu.org/events/). Look for "educationals" of Region 5 - they are trainings that are available to all of us.

- OPSEU is divided into regions. We are part of region 5. Each region has its own offices and employs staff to help the locals. Currently our staff representative is Christine Laverty.
